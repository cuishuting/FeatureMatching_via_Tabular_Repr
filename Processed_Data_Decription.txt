                                       2) with common_itemid between lab_CV & lab_MV
                                       3) common_hadm_id between lab_CV & chart_CV
                                          common_hadm_id between lab_MV & chart_MV
				                       4) contained itemids with recording fraction >= 30%
2. "mimic_chart_MV/CV_reg_pre.csv": 1) regular preprocessing is applied
                                    2) no common itemid and no common hadmid between 2 eras
                                    3) transfer all the numeric itemids' value type from "str" to "int"/"float"
                                    4) contains both numeric and categorical itemids' recordings
3. "mimic_chart_MV_only_num_del_onetime_itemid.csv": 1)selecting only numeric itemids' recordings from "mimic_chart_MV/CV_reg_pre.csv"
					                                 2) num_itemids' recording frequency are >= 30%
					                                 3) delete those one-time-recorded numeric itemids and add these(3 itemids) one-time-recorded numeric itemids into static_mv dataset
4. "mimic_chart_CV_only_numeric_new.csv": 1) regular preprocessing is applied (same as 2. 1))
                                          2) transfer the obvious numeric type itemid in mimic_chart_CV from string to float
                                             (some "unobvious" numeric itemids are currently regarded as categorical itemids)
                                          3) Only "categorical" itemids with unique values > 10 would be considered as alternative numeric itemids
                                             For these alternative numeric itemids, using Regular Expression to try to match
                                             the first index in the series returned by value_counts() for itemids in these alternative numeric itemids;
                                             if the first index has the form "xcm" or "x cm" or "xmm" or "x mm" or "Other/Remarks",
                                             then it will be selected to transform to numeric itemid.
                                          4) Extract the scalar part of these alternative numeric itemids and transform these scalar's values into float type
                                             Transform all the "Other/remark" values in these alternative numeric itemids into NaN
                                          5) The final numeric itemid list in chart_CV are the combination of "obvious" numeric itemids and those transformed alternative numeric itemids
                                          6) Also make sure that the hadm_id in "mimic_chart_CV_only_numeric.csv" keep the same with hadm_id in "mimic_lab_CV_reg_pre.csv"
				                          7) num_itemids' recording frequency are >= 30%
5. "mimic_chart_MV_only_cat.csv": 1) contains cat_itemid recordings in chart_mv after: a) unique values <= 10; b) "hadm_id"s are the same as those in file "mimic_chart_mv_only_numeric.csv"
                                                                                       c) recording frequency are >= 30%
                                  2) cat_itemids in chart_MV are all binary, but some type of value "1" is str, while other types of value "1" are int or float.
                                     transfer all those selected binary itemids's value type into 'integer': 0/1

6. "mimic_chart_CV_only_cat.csv": 1) contains cat_itemid recordings in chart_cv after: a) unique values <= 10; b) "hadm_id"s are the same as those in file "mimic_chart_cv_only_numeric.csv"
                                                                                       c) recording frequency are >= 30%
                                  2) all the values in "value" column in this file is the mapped value (details of map pairs are in file "../Org_Data_and_Preprocess_ipynbs/data/chart_cv_cat_itemids_unique_value_map.csv")


7. "mimic_static_CV/MV.csv": the hadm_id in these files are the intersection of the hadm_id in  mimic_lab_CV/MV_reg_pre.csv, mimic_chart_CV/MV_only_numeric/cat.csv
                             The details of included static variables are in file "Preprocess_Static_Variables.ipynb"
